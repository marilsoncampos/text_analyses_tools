Once upon a time, the boy and the dog had a pet frog.

the frog ran out of the jar and jumped out the window. Next morning, the boy and his dog looked into the jar, and they saw it was empty. Then the boy looked everywhere. The dog looked too. He tried to look in the jar, but his head got stuck. The boy opened the window and, called the frog's name. Then it jumped out of the window., he searched everywhere, but he couldn't find it. He was right or not. Then, he called his name in the woods and told a animal if it said, if it saw the frog, but the animal bit his nose. He looked in a barrel,, in a tree. He looked right on a rock and called the frog and hold on sticks, but they were actually a animal. It ran and ran. The dog ran along.

There was a lake. They fell in it, and the animal was looking too. Then, they heard a funny sound the boy heared. They fell off top one by one. Then the boy told the frog to be, I mean dog to be, very quiet. There was ... Then they looked on the other side. What do you think was on there?

Let's see. There was the frog and he has the mother frog too. Then they would have babies and one frog jumped to the boy. Well, well maybe the dog was very scared cause it did see a new animal before. Then they decide to keep the frog and for a new pet. The dog was very proud that they found a new pet. The frogs watched too. The end.
