The frog got out of its jar, so it could go back to its family. And then, then the boy, then the boy noticed his pet frog wasn't there.

So, they went to look.

But the dog got stuck in the jar. Then they called for, for the frog but it did not come. Then they went to the forest to look for them, to look for it and, and an animal bit his nose. Then, he ... then he looked in a tree and then he climbed up a rock and held on to some branches but they weren't really branches. They were actually, it was actually a deer.

They ran to the end of the forest. They were getting close to a hill. Then the deer pushed them off the hill. Then they went splash into the water and then they heard something behind a log and he said to be really careful, quiet to his dog.

And they ... guess what they saw at the end of the log?

Some frogs. A mama frog and a, and a, and a daddy frog. If my dad comes soon, he'll be so surprised. He'll get to meet Taga also cause he's going to be bringing my snugly.

And then, he saw some baby frogs.

So, and one of the frogs, one of the baby frogs hopped toward him and asked if he could be ... if the frog could be his new pet.

Then they went home with the new baby frog and they said goodbye to the other frogs.

And they all said goodbye.
