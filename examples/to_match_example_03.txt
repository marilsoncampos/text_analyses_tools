The frog was in the... They had a pet frog.

And then the next night, the frog came out the jar and open window to jump out.

Then the next morning, when they woke up, they couldn't find the, the, the frog.

And then, they were looking everywhere. Then the dog, the dog wanted to see in a can if he was stuck inside the glass. His head got stuck inside.

They looked everywhere. They called for him. They asked everyone.

They look in the forest.

And, they asked  . He looked grumpy, and then  .

 They looked, the boy looked in, in, inside, a hole in the tree.

And then there were not sticks.

It was a deer.

And, and then they fell in the water.

And, and looked more in the forest but they couldn't find it. And then, they fell in the water.

They fell into the water. And they saw a lily pad.

And they saw a land and then ... they heard a splash. And they   to be quiet. And the dog... Behind the lily pad, there was the family of frogs.

And they crept, the frog couldn't jump away because they were so quiet.

They found the frog.

With the big mother frog. They saw babies. And then jumped and got to the boy, and then the boy, they had a new pet frog baby.

And they said bye and the frogs looked at him as he was walking away.
