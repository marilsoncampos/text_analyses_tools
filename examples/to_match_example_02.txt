Okay. On a once upon a time.

Okay. Once upon a time, it was a frog who was missing in a jar.

And the boy looked everywhere and then...

When he saw that the frog wasn't in the jar, he, the little boy looked everywhere, even in his heart, out the window.

And outside in the woods. And, and a bumble bee thingy... And a gopher bit his nose. And he looked in the hole. And he looked on the rock and he was, he thought he was on the stick but it was antlers.

And he was on the deer's antlers head. And then the deer went on, and the little boy went on the deer's antlers and then he was run to the edge.

And then he fell off and then the deer went back to where they found them. Those rocks. And they thought they heard a frog noise and they didn't move, and then he looked under there and there was the frog.

And the baby frogs.

And they would live happy ever after!

The end.
